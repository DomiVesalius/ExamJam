Consider talking more in-depth about your target audience. What kind of students? from where? 
With what level of education? Being more specific about target users may reveal more about 
specific needs and can help cater your app to your users. 

You should specify whether your app is made for asking questions or posting exam answers, 
since your proposal talks about both. Also, talk about competitors and how your solution 
stands out from the rest.

Also it seems unlikely that students will spontaneously form communities outside of class 
and post exam answers. This could potentially lead to academic dishonesty issues, have you 
made sure everything your app does is allowed by schools? Since if it isnâ€™t, your user 
base will be much smaller.

This proposal is overall very short and misses many key ideas. Consider adding more detail 
and being more specific about the problems your app solves and why users should use your 
solution rather than others currently on the market.
