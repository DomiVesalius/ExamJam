## Practices to Continue During Next Sprint

1.   Holding standups every other day (or as many as possible) to notify others what everyone is currently working on.
2. Using storybook for testing frontend components

## New Practices to Use During Next Sprint

1.   Starting our tasks earlier to avoid having to do the bulk of the work in the last week. This would also avoid any blockers for others
2. Referencing the documentation for specific technologies rather than rely on YouTube videos
3. Doing additional testing for completed tasks prior to creating pull requests
4. Updating trello more frequently
5. Distribute user stories/work based on others schedule and strengths

## Harmful Practices to Stop Using Next Sprint

1.   Daily standups.
     -   Reduce to standups every other day.
2.   Although some may be busy on certain days/weeks due to other courses, they should try to spend some time with the project each day so that their workload doesn't pile up towards the deadline.
3. Stop leaving sprint deliverables to the last minute
4. Underestimating the workload of separate tasks

## Best/Worst Experience During Sprint 1

-   Kyuhyun Ryu
    -   Best: Working with new tech stack such as React and MUI to design the search bar.
    -   Worst: Because Harshit dropped the course and was part of my user story, I felt overwhelmed by the work needed to do. There was also some communication issues between him and I.
-   Ananth Chebolu
    -   Best: Working with a npm module to render a PDF file.
    -   Worst: 2/7 partners dropping the course.
-   Mohammad Qadir

    - Worst: Having the team drop by 2 people in the last few days before the deadline and having to start and finish their work since they did not start their tasks.
-   Fernando Mancini
    -  Best: Getting the form to work properly and to be have it properly connected to the backend
    -  Worst: Having 2 groupmates drop out mid sprint, including my feature partner.
