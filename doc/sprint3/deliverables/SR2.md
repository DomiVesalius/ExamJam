## Unfinished Tasks from sprint 2

-   None

## Practices to Continue During Next Sprint

1. Holding standups every other day (or as many as possible) to notify others what everyone is currently working on.
2. Using storybook for testing frontend components
3. Referencing the documentation for specific technologies rather than rely on YouTube videos
4. Distribute user stories/work based on others schedule and strengths
5. Updating trello more frequently

## New Practices to Use During Next Sprint

1. Starting our tasks earlier to avoid having to do the bulk of the work in the last week. This would also avoid any blockers for others
2. Doing additional testing for completed tasks prior to creating pull requests

## Harmful Practices to Stop Using Next Sprint

1. Although some may be busy on certain days/weeks due to other courses, they should try to spend some time with the project each day so that their workload doesn't pile up towards the deadline.
2. Stop leaving sprint deliverables to the last minute
3. Underestimating the workload of separate tasks
