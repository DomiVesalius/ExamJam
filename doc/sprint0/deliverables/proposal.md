## Objective

To develop a full-stack web application that serves as a platform for university students to ask questions related to
courses at their university. The application will allow students to collectively contribute to a central repository of
course related information.

The primary issue we aim to solve through this web application is the inefficiency involved in studying during midterm
and exam season, particularly studying by doing past exams and not immediately knowing if the answers you are coming up 
with are correct.

By providing a centralized platform to host discussion about previous exam questions, students from
current semesters will be able to easily collaborate with each other, and future students will be able to quickly access
past discussions. This would prevent students from possibly forming bad habits or misconceptions of course content
whilst studying for term tests or finals.

## Key Users

1. Students that require help in one or more courses
2. Students that want to consolidate their knowledge by answering other students' questions

Target Market: University Students

We hope to start with UofT students within the first few sprints and eventually open up to any university
student.
