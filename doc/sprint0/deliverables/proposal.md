# Proposal

## ExamJam

### Objective

Our objective is to create a highly collaborative, discussion-based platform that lets University of Toronto students 
study past exams with their peers. We want all discussions on the platform to be persistent in order to readily support 
the students of now and the future with their exam preparation.

We aim to solve the issue of students inefficiently studying for term-tests or exams by minimizing the amount of time 
they spend waiting for professors or other students to look over their answers to past exams. Initially, this would require students to crowdsource such information but the initial lack of content can be dealt with by scraping/aggregating answers from other sources such as StackOverflow or Piazza groups. After students make use of our project by asking and answering questions and the dataset has grown, students from future semesters will benefit as there will be no loss of information that comes with Piazza. Furthermore, since this will serve as a central repository for exam answers for past exams at UofT, students will have an easier time finding such information.

We recognize that an application such as this may deter students out of fear of committing an academic offense but 
there will be mechanisms to maintain academic integrity such as moderation, reporting, and directly tying user accounts to UofT email addresses.

### Key Personas

* Dalton Meyer 
  * A 19-year-old student that extensively relies on past exams for studying due to having a long commute to school.

* Leonardo Wiater 
  * Hardworking and well-liked TA and 4th-year student. Deeply passionate about readying students for exams but feels 
  * his office hours are insufficient to help his students.

### Key Scenarios

* Dalton is a student at UofT. When studying for tests and final exams, Dalton uses past exams for practice. However, Dalton is faced with an issue. Knowing that, in many cases, professors will not immediately give solutions to past exams without students first attempting questions for themselves, Dalton attempts the past exams and asks his professors for help in determining whether his solutions are correct. He has a few friends in the course he can talk to, but those same friends are unsure of their answers. 
* Leo is in his last year at UofT and is a TA. He wants to do more to help the students he’s teaching. Every semester, his students attend Leo’s office hours for help with past exam questions. Because Leo is popular among students, he cannot dedicate a single hour (per course) to help all the students with past exam questions.

### Principles

#### Persistence
With Exam Jam, questions and answers remain on the site permanently. In contrast to sites like piazza where good 
questions and answers pertaining to a class are unused after a class is done.

#### Accessibility
UofT students and students from other universities can get access to class content such as exams and questions/answers 
all in one place. Anybody within the university who has useful questions or input is able to post and contribute.

#### Simplicity
The site has few components in the layout, the functionality and purpose of each component is clear and not overwhelming.

### Market Analysis

The project will initially be targeted towards University of Toronto students for all stages of release throughout this 
term. The reason being is that we want to have a strong foundation in our MVP before branching out. If time permits, we 
aim to extend this to other academic institutions in North America. 

With regard to competitors, any Q&A platform can be considered a competitor since exam questions can be asked on any of 
those platforms. What other platforms cannot guarantee is an academically honest experience since those platforms cannot
view university exams due to intellectual property laws. Our platform requires a university email and access is only 
limited to exams provided from that university. For instance, UofT students can only see UofT past exams.
