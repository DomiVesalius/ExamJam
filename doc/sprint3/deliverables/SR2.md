## Unfinished Tasks from sprint 2

-   None

## Practices to Continue During Next Sprint

1. Holding standups every other day (or as many as possible) to notify others what everyone is currently working on.
2. Using storybook for testing frontend components
3. Referencing the documentation for specific technologies rather than rely on YouTube videos
4. Distribute user stories/work based on others schedule and strengths
5. Updating trello more frequently

## New Practices to Use During Next Sprint

1. Starting our tasks earlier to avoid having to do the bulk of the work in the last week. This would also avoid any blockers for others
2. Doing additional testing for completed tasks prior to creating pull requests
3. Having accountability meetings with members that are working on a user story that has been identified as working on blocking user stories
4. Setting hard deadlines for blocking user stories to allow for adequate time for other stories

## Harmful Practices to Stop Using Next Sprint

1. Leaving all work to the last 2 days before the deadline. This doesn't leave any buffer room for complications.
2. Stop leaving sprint deliverables to the last minute

## Best/Worst Experience During Sprint 2

-   Kyuhyun Ryu
    -   Best: Creating the search bar that fetches all courses based on keyword live 
    -   Worst: Connecting storybook to backend container (held in Docker)
-  Ananth Chebolu
    -   Best: File streaming using GRID fs was the best part. It helped me learn about Grid FS. I set up my first end point which was a very cool experience.
    -   Worst: Setting up the file streaming end point while using TSOA was a really big time sink. It took up a lot of time for a very unnecessary reason. 
-   Mohammad Qadir
    -   Best: Seeing parts of the application come together and act as a whole
    -   Worst: Pulling an all-nighter for debugging and getting everything ready for the sprint 2 demo
-   Fernando Mancini
    -   Best: Learned how to work on the backend and to create endpoints
    -   Worst: Understanding how pagination worked for backend and frontend
-   Abhinav Meda
    -   Best: Creating endpoints to retrieve the data we previously collected
    -   Worst: Reading TSOA documentation
