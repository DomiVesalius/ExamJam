## Unfinished Tasks from sprint 3

-   None

## Practices to Continue During Next Sprint

1. Holding standups every other day (or as many as possible) to notify others what everyone is currently working on.
2. Using storybook for testing frontend components
3. Referencing the documentation for specific technologies rather than rely on YouTube videos
4. Distribute user stories/work based on others schedule and strengths
5. Updating trello more frequently
6. Setting hard deadlines for blocking user stories to allow for adequate time for other stories
7. Having accountability meetings with members that are working on a user story that has been identified as working on blocking user stories

## New Practices to Use During Next Sprint

1. Starting our tasks earlier to avoid having to do the bulk of the work in the last week. This would also avoid any blockers for others
2. Doing additional testing for completed tasks prior to creating pull requests

## Harmful Practices to Stop Using Next Sprint

1. Completing tasks around 10pm on the Thursday prior to the sprint demo. Does not give enough room to check for and fix bugs or do code reviews.
