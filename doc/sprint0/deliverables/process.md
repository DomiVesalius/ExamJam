# Process

## Team Organization & Roles
During the first meeting deliverables were assigned to members by considering who was interested in doing the task.
For larger deliverables, we opted to do them as a group.

| Name             | Task Completed                                                                       |

## Tools
* Strawpoll for anonymous voting.
* Google Drive for deliverable files
* [when2meet.com](https://www.when2meet.com/) for planning meetings

## Decision-Making
* We allocate a portion of our meetings for sharing ideas and making decisions on them.
* We prioritize which decisions need to be made first based on their importance and relevance. For example, user stories are roughly discussed in order of their assigned priority level.
* When assessing a decision, we set a time frame (possibly days) within which the decision should be made and all the information can be considered properly.
* Each team member can weigh in on the decision to provide their thoughts, ideas and criticisms. It's also emphasized that people don’t talk over each other so that ideas get across clearly.
* Based on pros and cons provided we decide whether to go forward with the idea.
* For particularly important decisions we would have a vote on it using StrawPoll and make the decision based on the majority. Such as for priority level assigned to particular user stories.

## Prioritizing User stories
User stories are prioritized by:
* Dependence on other stories: So if one story is dependent on several other stories then it's naturally lower in priority. For example, an authentication system (login/logout/register) must be completed before a majority of other user stories.
* Difficulty: The number of difficulty points allocated to a story is weighted against the relevance of the story to the core concept of the app.
* Must have: Certain stories are critical to our application. The stories can be roughly prioritized by necessity vs being a secondary feature to a program. For example: being able to post comments on discussion threads is higher in priority than being able to switch between light and dark mode.
* Should have: These stories may be important to the application, such as being able to upvote and downvote posts. Though they are important to the success of the application, they are not critical.
* Could have: These stories are not particularly important to the application and should be done if there is remaining time. Such as implementing a light and dark mode.
* Won’t have: These are stories that will not add much value to the application, they may be worked on after everything else. Such as implementing an ability to stay signed in.

When prioritizing user stories, we needed at most two rounds of voting to come to a consensus about the priority of each
story. When adding stories, there was emphasis on being specific enough so as to make their difficulty level and relevance clear.

## Meetings
There were four meetings which were all online throughout sprint 0.
* January 14, 4:00pm - 5:15pm
    * Brainstorming Ideas
* January 21, 2:00pm - 4:00pm
    * Brainstorming Ideas
    * Working on deliverables
* January 24, 7:00pm - 9:00pm
    * Working on deliverables
* January 28, 4:00pm - 6:00pm
    * Working on deliverables

* We scheduled these meetings based on availability that members entered into when2meet for four specific days during the week.
* The meetings were hosted on a discord voice channel in a server for the project. For each meeting we also planned the topics to be discussed as shown above.
* For specific days such as the 24th we placed special emphasis on discussing topics related to things due the next day according to deadlines set for group members.

## Next phase
### Having an Agenda
* After several meetings in week 1 we realized that to get the most out of meetings in terms of productivity and efficiency, it would be best to first determine the topics that we’d like to discuss.
* For each of the discussion topics we allocated a certain amount of time within which we would discuss them.

### Sharing Ideas
* We also have a system of sharing ideas and giving input within meetings in order to prevent people from talking over each other and to make sure we stay on topic.
* We read through the list of team members one at a time and each team member has an opportunity to share their ideas and thoughts in relation to what they have done during the week.
* When discussing a topic team members are required to speak one at a time and the speaker shouldn’t be interrupted.

### Comfortable Environment
* An issue in group projects is that members are sometimes nervous or uncomfortable to ask questions and communicate with the team.
* We placed emphasis on the environment being open and judgment free in regards to communicating about tasks and asking questions.
* This ensures that when working on parts of the application, issues get resolved quickly and work can be done quickly and efficiently with less issues due to lack of communication.
