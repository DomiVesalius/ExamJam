## [Piazza](https://piazza.com)
* Platform for facilitating discussions between course instructors and students 
* Supports private posts and each course has its own piazza course instance so discussions are kept separate between courses 
* Past exam discussions and feedback provided for them is up to the discretion of the instructor(s) moderating the piazza course instance. This means if they choose not to provide help, students will have to make do with going to office hours, which may also be limited during exam season 
* Our product is different from Piazza because the experience is centered around only discussing past exam which is often not the objective of piazza course instance 
* Our product is better for… 
  * Multi-year exam discussions which means students discussing an exam now, will have access to discussions students had previously about the same exam 
  * Easily accessing, viewing, and discussing past UofT exams. On Piazza, full exams cannot be uploaded and students are limited to uploading screenshots for questions they need help with. 
  * Persistent discussions since piazza course instances are locked down after a course is finished
